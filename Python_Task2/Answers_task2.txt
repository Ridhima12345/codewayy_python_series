Why is list used?

The list is a most versatile datatype available in Python which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items)
between square brackets.
Important thing about a list is that items in a list need not be of the same type.
Lists are mutable,so changes can be made to them after it has been initialized.

How do lists and sets differ?


Sets â€” Unordered collections of unique elements

Lists - Ordered collections of elements

Sets allows you to do operations such as intersection, union, difference, and symmetric difference.

Lists are really variable-length arrays, not Lisp-style linked lists. In lists the elements are accessed by indices.

List can be 2-D whereas a set can't.

As list are ordered (IE. have serial number) list are comparatively slow to execute whereas sets are fast.

List in python is like Array of java or c.

Printing a set almost always provide different sequence of output.

Set uses hash function to find an element whereas list is an array. Hence finding element in Set is faster than in list.

Application of dictionaries with a real world example.

Example of a dictionary.

1)If I am working to analyze a bunch of stats for a sports team. 
All the data is entered by the players numbers. 
I can find the details of the player using player number.

2) A dictionary that we use to find meaning of words.
The word can be the key and meaning will be the value.
